# copy to /home/$NEWUSER1/.rtorrent.rc and enable/modify the options as needed

# based on original .rtorrent.rc file from The libTorrent and rTorrent Project

# /torrents/downloading - temporary location for torrents while downloading (see "directory")
# /torrents/complete - torrents are moved here when complete (see "on_finished")
# /torrents/torrentfiles/auto - the "autoload" directory for rtorrent to use
# rtorrent will automatically load .torrents placed here. (see "schedule = watch_directory")
# /torrents/downloading/rtorrent.session - for storing rtorrent session information
